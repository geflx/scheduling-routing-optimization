# Integrated Machine Scheduling and Vehicle Routing Problem

Solving the problem of schueduling jobs to be processed in a linear machine and then decide routes and vehicles to perform the delivery. A different approach of the problem is treated here with included factors like the jobs and vehicle different sizes.
Solutions are showing good results in a very short time using metaheuristics (compared to IBM ILOG CPLEX).

## Instances
This different approach required new instances and they were generated based in articles described in .pdf attached. (continue)

## Metaheuristics
In this application were applied different metaheuristics, starting with Iterated Local Search (ILS)- RVND and then extending to Genetic Algorithms, ... (continue)
